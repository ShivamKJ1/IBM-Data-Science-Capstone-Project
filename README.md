# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-Project

🚀 SpaceX Launch Data Analysis & Prediction
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data science lifecycle applied to SpaceX launch data. The goal is to analyze launch records, build predictive models for mission success, and create interactive dashboards for data-driven insights.

🗂️ Project Workflow

Data Collection

Retrieved SpaceX launch data using REST APIs and web scraping.

Data Wrangling

Cleaned, transformed, and standardized raw data for downstream tasks using pandas and NumPy.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

SQL queries and Python-based visualizations to uncover launch trends, payload distributions, and booster performance.

Interactive Visual Analytics

Built dashboards with Plotly Dash and Folium for geospatial and interactive insights.

Features include site-based filtering, payload range sliders, success/failure distribution, and scatter plots.

Predictive Modeling

Applied classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.) to predict launch success.

Evaluated models with metrics such as accuracy and F1-score.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Languages & Libraries: Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Folium

Dashboards: Plotly Dash, Folium

Data Sources: SpaceX REST API, Web Scraping

SQL: SQLite for exploratory queries
